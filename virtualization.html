    <h2>Virtualization</h1>
    <p>
      In computing, <strong>virtualization </strong> refers to
      the act of creating a virtual (<i>rather than actual</i>) version of something.<br>
      This includes virtual computer hardware, virtual storage devices and
      virtual network resources.
    </p>

    <h1>Levels of Virtualization</h1>
    
    <ol>
<li>
    <strong>   Virtualization at Instruction Set Architecture(ISA) level </strong>
</br>
    <br>
     Every machine has an instruction set. This instruction set is an interface between software
     and hardware. Using this instructions software can communicate with
     hardware. 
</li>
</br>
<li>

   <strong> 
    Virtualization at Operating System(O.S.) level </strong>
   </br>
</br>
    In virtualization at HAL level each virtual machine is built from scratch i.e. by installing
    O.S., application suites, networking systems, etc.
    <ul>
        <li>
    In cloud sometimes, we need to initialize 100 Virtual machines at a single time, If we use
    virtualization at Hardware abstraction layer(HAL) level this can take too much time.
</li>
<li>

    So to overcome this in Virtualization at Operating system level we share operating system between Virtual machines along with the hardware.
</li>
</ul>

</ol>
